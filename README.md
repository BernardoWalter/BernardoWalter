- Hi, I’m @Bernardo Walter,
- I’m using Dexcom G7 since a few days after having used G6 and Xdrip+ for several years.
- First of all I would like to thank you very much for your impressing work. I highly appreciate it.
- My doc now asked me to receive my data via dexcom clarity. So I installed the original Apps from Dexcom although I like to use the xdrip app much more.
- I thought it should not be a big thing to get my data into xdrip+ by using Dex Share Follower as the data base.
- After having setup an user as follower I do receive the data in the dexcom follower app.
- Hereafter I installed the newest version of xdrip+, entered
- - Dex Share Follower
  - username and
  - password
  in the settings but it doesn't work.
- I get the Share login error:
- Publisher account password failed code: 500
- I have changed the username and the password in my dexcom account several times but it did not help.
- Due to this frustrating experience I would be grateful if you could let me know how to settle this item.
- Kind regards from Germany,
- Bernardo
